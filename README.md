###Defining the problem
The problem I want to solve is to see the ratings & reviews given by Snapchat consumers over the three years and to understand the reason why it has fluctuated.

###Planning
What are we measuring and how?
I will measure 10k snapchat reviews over the period 2019-2021 and check if the ratings have increased or decreased during this time. I will then investigate why.

###Where we will collect the data
I have collected this data from Kaggle - Source: https://www.kaggle.com/databar/10k-snapchat-reviews
